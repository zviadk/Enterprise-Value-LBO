Valuation impact of a leveraged buyout
This spreadsheet models the valuation impact of a leveraged buyout (LBO) by analyzing pre- and post-LBO weighted average cost of capital (WACC), return on invested capital (ROIC), and equity value creation. It incorporates financial metrics such as the cost of debt, equity beta adjustments using the Fernandez equation, and enterprise valuation based on future economic value added (EVA). Key calculations include pre- and post-LBO firm valuation, debt levels, and shareholder benefits, quantifying the financial and operational improvements resulting from the transaction.
